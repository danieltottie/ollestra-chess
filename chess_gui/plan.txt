Chess GUI - separate window and chess graphics.
Put network stuff in separate file.
main file runs window.

Normal mode. Offline. 

GUI includes chess piece board. Can we translate this to fen notation directly? (would be interesting if we could use the fen parser)

Boards are kept separate on server and on client. Moves are verified on both sides. After both have verified, the piece is moved on both sides, so its more of a peer-to-peer structure, but one side connects to the other.

player logic is implemented in network settings


All of this is essentially the same as before except it awaits network input every second move



Today:
Set up server and make it accept input
